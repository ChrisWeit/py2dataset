The main purpose of this file is to define the metadata for your project and provides instructions on how to build and distribute your module distribution (in our case &#x27;py2dataset&#x27;).<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s what the setup() function does:<br/>- It defines the name of the package, its version number, author and email address. <br/>- The description field is a one-line summary about what the project does in fewer words.<br/>- The long_description reads from README.md file which contains detailed information about your project. This can be written in markdown or reStructuredText format.<br/>- The url specifies the URL for the home page of your project. <br/>- py_modules is a list of Python modules to include as part of the distribution, they don&#x27;t need to be python packages and will not appear in the package&#x27;s namespace. <br/>- classifiers are keywords or tags that describe your project to make it easier for users to find and navigate through PyPI (the Python Package Index). In our case, we&#x27;re defining a programming language as Python version 3, OSI Approved license which is MIT License, and operating system independent.<br/>- python_requires defines the minimal required version of Python. Here, &#x27;&gt;=3.8&#x27; means that your package will work with all versions of Python greater than or equal to 3.8.<br/>- install_requires are a list of other packages this package requires at runtime to function. These packages need to be installed separately before installing this package using pip.<br/>- entry_points is used when the script in setup.py needs command line access, it associates the &#x27;py2dataset&#x27; command with the main() function inside py2dataset module which will get executed when user types &#x27;py2dataset&#x27; at the command prompt.<br/>- packages lists all python packages that should be included in the sdist distribution for your project. Here, we&#x27;re only including one package named &#x27;py2dataset&#x27;.<br/>- package_dir is a dictionary mapping from the name of each Python package to its location on the filesystem. In our case, we&#x27;ve provided relative path to where &#x27;py2dataset&#x27; module exists and it&#x27;s being included in the sdist distribution for the project.</td></tr>
